### freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Certification

This is a single-page application I created for showcasing the solutions for the five final projects developed in React for the **Front End Development Libraries Certification** of the [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

The projects included are:  
1. Random Quote Generator
2. Markdown Previewer
3. Drum Machine
4. Javascript Calculator 
5. 25 + 5 Clock

This was created using HTML, CSS and React. For the design I followed [React's official page](https://reactjs.org).
